        <p>BTS has taken over the charts, the radio, the Grammys, the Guinness World Records book, but that's not all. Now, the blockbuster South Korean boy band can add taking over the White House to the list.<br>
        In celebration of the final day of AANHPI Heritage Month on Tuesday (May 31), Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook took on Washington, D.C., for a press conference. There they gave the opening remarks during a press briefing on the importance of standing against anti-Asian hate crimes, and also had a 35-minute meeting with President Joe Biden in the Oval Office.
        First addressing about 100 journalists in the White House Press Briefing room, the seven bandmates each made individual comments thanking the Biden administration as well as their fanbase, and discussed their stance on halting discrimination against Asian people. “We were devastated by the recent surge of hate crimes, including anti-Asian hate crimes,” said Jimin during his turn behind the microphone. “To put a stop on this and support the cause, we'd like to take this opportunity to voice ourselves once again.”
        Afterward came their conversation with the president - which made them the first Korean artists to discuss anti-Asian hate with a U.S. president at the White House - during which Biden thanked the guys for using their platform to help make a difference. “People care a lot about what you say, and what you're doing is good for all people,” he told them. “It's not just your great talent, it's the message you're communicating. It matters.”</p>
